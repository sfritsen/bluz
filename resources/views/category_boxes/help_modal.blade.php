                    You can add items up to 4 levels deep.  Please ensure the entry form has the appropriate amount of box menu fields
                    for the amount of items you wish to use.  If there are 3 boxes on the entry form, all level 4 items will not be shown.

                        <ol>
                            <li>In the table below, navigate to the section you want to add an item too.</li>
                            <li>Enter the text in the "Add New Item" field worded as you want.</li>
                            <li>Press Submit</li>

                    </p>
                    The item should appear in list sorted automatically and active.  You can use the quick navigation above the table 
                    to navigate back to the previous levels if needed.

                    At this time, editing is not permitted.  Entries are logged with the items value and have a general subject to them.  By editing, you run the risk of altering 
                    the subject which can change the previous records accuracy.
                    If you want an item changed, there are 2 options.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Delete the item then create a new one with the changes you want</li>
                        <li>Email an admin which can alter the item</li>

                        By pressing the "Delete" button, it will remove the item from the list in both active and disabled states.  This will not actually delete the item 
                        but instead set a flag on it marking it as deleted.
                    </p>
                    <p>To recover a deleted item, click "Trash Bin" from the top submenu and click "Restore".  This will move the item back into your main list.</p>
